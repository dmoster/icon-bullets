# Icon Bullets
Icon Bullets is a pluggable framework that allows you to use your favorite icon packs as bullet points in an unordered list.

## Getting Started


## Developer's Notes
The space for each bullet will have to allow for differing bullet sizes. This may be accomplished by making the x-axis `padding` of each icon dynamically sized. Each icon should be:
- centered in its `padding`
- the same total width once `padding` has been added
